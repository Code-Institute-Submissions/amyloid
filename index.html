                <h2>Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis</h2>
                <p>
                    can affect the kidneys, spleen, heart, and other organs. People with conditions such as multiple myeloma or a bone marrow illness called Wadenström’s macroglobulinemia are more likely to have AL amyloidosis.

                <h2>AA amyloidosis</h2>
                <p>
                    is caused by fragments of amyloid A protein, and affects the kidneys in about 80 percent of cases. It can complicate chronic diseases characterized by inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBS).

                <h2>Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR)</h2>
                <p>
                    can be inherited from a family member (familial amyloidosis). People of African descent may be more likely to carry the gene that causes this kind of amyloidosis. Transthyretin is a protein that is also known as prealbumin. It is made in the liver. Excessive normal (wild-type ATTR) or mutant transthyretin can cause amyloid deposits.
