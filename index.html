    <p>
        A life-changing treatment for amyloidosis, a progressive, fatal disease that is disproportionately common in Ireland, is being made available through the Health Service Executive for the first time. <br>
        Up to 1 per cent of the population of Co Donegal has been estimated to have the hereditary condition. Sinn Féin’s Martin McGuinness, whose mother hailed from the Inishowen peninsula, died of the disease in 2017. The HSE said it has approved reimbursement of the “gene silencing” medicine Patirisan from October 1st, in line with an access protocol to be published shortly.<br>
        Patrisan is used to treat hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis, an inherited, rare, life-limiting and multisystemic disease for which treatment options have been limited up to now. The condition is caused by deposits of abnormal protein – amyloid – in tissues and organs throughout the body. This can cause tissues and organs to stop working properly.<br>
        There are about 30 different proteins that can misfold and form amyloid, and therefore many different types of amyloidosis.
